<p>It only comes into play if the elements must shrink to fit into their container — i.e. when the container is just too small.
Its main use is to specify which items you want to shrink, and which items you don’t. By default, every square has a flex-shrink of 1 — which means it will shrink as the box contracts.
Let’s see it in action. In the below GIFS, the squares have a flex-grow of 1, so they fill the container, and a flex-shrink of 1, so they’re permitted to shrink as it does.
